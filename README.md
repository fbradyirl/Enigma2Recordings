![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbradyirl/Enigma2Recordings/master/screenshot1.png)

Working so far:

* View a list of all recordings
* Click on a recording to start watching from the beginning
* Click on 4 or 6 on the remote to move back or forward 60 seconds
* Click on 7 or 9 on the remote to move back or forward 5 minutes
* Artwork is fetched, thanks to themoviedb.org and tmdb.org

Yet to do:

* Show screen to input Enigma box IP (it is hardcoded for now)
* Select correct audio track during playback
* Complete video overlay to show progress and time elapsed/remaining.
* Show extended description in main list when selected.
* Remember playback position from last time, for each video
* Re-skin
